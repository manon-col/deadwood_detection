Enter all measurements in centimetres; they will be converted into metres by the R program.
Notation of the files: n°plot_n°element(_n°strand if several strands are measured, e.g. if there is a fork).
If forks are present: the total length and the circumference at mid-length of the main strand (the first measured) are kept.
